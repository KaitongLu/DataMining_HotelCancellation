# DataMining_HotelCancellation

## Problem setting
Major Online Travel Agency (OTA) platforms make it much easier for people to travel. To attract more users to book, most OTA will set loose cancellation policies, such as free cancellation at any time or at a limited time. “Free cancellation” is a good policy for consumers because they can have more choices. However, for hotels, cancelling booking orders usually results in loss of hotel revenue. Therefore, in this project, we are trying to find the best model for predicting hotel bookings cancellation to reduce hotels losses under “free cancellation” policies.
